- `category` - Part category
- `application` - Where the part is used
- `stock_quantity` - Current stock
- `unit_cost` / `unit_price` - Pricing
- Plus 40+ additional technical fields

**Action Required:**
When you receive your diesel parts data, you can:
1. Use the existing import script (`import_data.py`)
2. Update the CSV mapping to match your diesel parts fields
3. Run the import to populate the database
